You wanna encourage overweight people to use your product and start working out ? I’m 100% for that. However, this ‘’obese are as healthy as others’’ is a bad thing. It makes obese people believe that they’re fit, which they aren’t. Show her swimming, walking, running, golfing play volleyball or anything that she can ACTUALLY do to get fit.

tangerinesunse,"@balleduquebec I can’t see how large she is but she doesn’t seem a ton larger than I am. Overweight surfers are NOT common. This is an actress doing her best. 

The more I think about it the more I’m annoyed that they chose someone who was this size and NOT good at surfing. The fact is, they should have chosen a more athletic overweight/obese person to do the commercial.

It’s seriously adding to peoples misunderstandings of fat peoples abilities and skills. Fat on the body doesn’t necessarily mean totally out of shape and no muscles. There’s a lot of reason an athletic and strong person might also be obese.

This is literally WHY the fat acceptance movement is important.

I’ve been large my whole life and have a hormone issue. It’s invisible minus my obvious weight. All my life I have been shamed for this. But that doesn’t piss me off as much as when people assume that this body type also means I’m weak and a lazy loser.",,arn9xVX,0,C

But yeah, it IS a little problematic. I am quite fit and if I don't get my cardio up 2-3 weeks before my occasional surfing trip, the sea will literally murder me. 
Still more of a beginner, sure, and clean technique might improve things further in the future ... but, honestly, I don't think you can surf a proper spot without a high fitness level and even attempting it is super dangerous.

The upside is it lowers anxiety and if anyone halfway intelligent uses them- it really helps with things like thought/speech transitioning when used at a moderate dose. The only major downside is that ""moderate"" dosage jumps up at a ridiculously fast pace and will nearly end you if you just ""quit"".

I lived with an obese person and 15 min walk is the max they can do, they cannot run,.squat ,lift, go trekking and so on. Their life is limited due to their gluttony. At the age of 18-20-25 they function at a worse level then a fit 50 years old. In reality these people are important for companies because they consume so much.

That being said, I’ll focus my point on just diabetes, because I’ve seen the effects of that in a family member. Diabetes is referred to as the silent killer because its progressive and slow ( I’m referring to type 2) . You can feel fine for many years, let’s even say “feel comfortable in your body” , your overweight body. Until one day you go see a doctor and you’re told your A1C is 12 .

The way I see it it's a matter of magnitude. Extremely unhealthy examples like Tess Holiday (or Kate Moss for a good part of the '90) needs to be pointed out sure, but there must be a reasonably wide range of acceptability. Not having that is how extremes physiques are implicitly promoted.

Obesity is the problem which is a serious health hazard. The woman here in the post is somewhat okay , not obese but overweight. Being overweight is acceptable, can be good looking even, obesity is not. There is an official measure for definining from which point somebody is obese and not overweight. These are my thoughts not JP s. I think in this video he expresses himself in an unprofessional way. Still I think his problem with obesity roots at the health implifications which come with it and the fact that we try to make money out of obese people. Thats why he mentions health in the video and says the girl is exploited.

Also anorexia is a mental disease or malfunction and to become obese is mostly the lack of self control, not being sick. Also obesity is a much bigger problem cuz there are thousand times more obese people then anorexic. Obesity kills you slowrr vut turn your life into a parody of what it should be. It jills self esteem and the answer is not accepting it but doing against it. If somebody has bad teeth and he matters to you you tell them. Same with hygiene,smoking, drugs.

I mean he often claims scientific authority, but at the same time places more value in his anecdotical experience than in the scientific method. Like with that weird ""only beef"" diet thing. I feel he's also getting worse with time.

Now I try to pay more attention to actual coherence and rationality of his positions, than to the way he talks about a topic. There are lots of ""false authority"" arguments and such.

I'm not in need of a father figure, I'm not in need of salvation. I think most of JBPs (religious) waffling is part of a coping mechanism he developed because his life was mostly shit (and as a result of depression (medicine) induced hallucinations).

Sure, he doesn't practice what he preaches, but that's not the dig you seem to think it is. He knows he's fucked up. Yet he's tried his best to deal with it. Just because he has been unsuccessful, doesn't mean it's invalid.

Step 3: incorporate a daily activity routine. You don’t have to become a gym rat. Just take the bike for groceries, go for a walk daily, park a little further away from work, so you have to walk a bit to work, get a stationary bike, get a Fitbit and make 5k steps to Beginn with, work your way up…….there are no valid excuses to this point.
Step 5: track your progress and consider: even the most gifted people are not able to loose more than 500g of fat per week (plus minus) and don’t get frustrated when you drop several kilos in the first weeks. There are more factors to weight as there are to fat (hydration le",,arn9xVX,8,C

Additional hacks:",,arn9xVX,8,C
saifin,"@oldefart 1. Start putting a huge glass of water next to your bed every evening and drink it first thing in the morning. You want to stay hydrated, as All metabolic activities will benefit from it and massively reduce high blood pressure. Then ad a huge glass to every meal and then in between. Go for 1L / 20g  body weight in the long run. That was a game changer for me.
2. Last meal should contain mostly fats…avocado, nuts, omelette, Greek yogurt….serves as ebergy source during the night and helps your body regulating your hormone levels
3. Last meal should be 4 hours before sleeping, which helps regulating and stabilize your blood sugar levels (hence insulin) during the night and the quality of sleep will rapidly increase. You will be more energized with lesser sleep. Sleep is king, believe me.

E.g. China seems to have massive knife stabbing sprees (at worst 30 deaths by one go) and also regular school attacks. That country has one of the strictest gun control laws in the world.

They have assault knives? Or could it be that there are other societal factors that cause people want to harm others?

Just like somehow e.g. Switzerland does not seem to have problems with their weapons, their weapons are more peaceful models than is US? They have Colt Peacemakers and US got only Colt Warmakers?

However, your 'not so simple with guns' argument only works when guns are relatively rare. In the gunowner's utopia, in which everyone is armed, there's no need to search for a victim... because everyone is armed.

eodbatman,"@dad_is_that_you I am well aware of what these ""assault rifles"" are, but depending on who is calling it an assault rifle, the definition varies. You will notice, if you read, that I mentioned they were semi-automatic, not fully automatic or even burst capable (though bump stucks kind of blue that line).  When the Left talks about high capacity magazines, they are almost always referring to anything that carries more than 5-10 rounds. The 30 round magazine is the standard because that's what the Army uses for it's M-4. I think it's stupid and useless to say assault weapons don't exist or to get caught up in the definition when we all know what they mean by assault rifle. I think it's far more useful and honest to say that yes, my AR-15 would be a perfectly useful and adequate battlefield weapon, because it is, and that's exactly why we own them.",,ajgGBB0,3,C

It’s actually been used by militaries.",,ajgGBB0,3,C
eodbatman,"@dad_is_that_you Jesus you people are dense. I'm merely explaining what the media and others mean when they say assault rifle or assault weapon, not disputing the definition. And yes, the AR-15 is essentially a battlefield rifle. If you'd ever served in the military, you'd know why I say that. You can't hit shit on full auto with an M4 so no one really uses it even in combat. I would actually prefer my personal AR over my issued weapon, because I think it's better.

Many are ""independant contractors"" basicly the ol' wrestling thing. They aren't employees, so they don't get health benefits, insurance and so on. Instead they're independant contractors, taking jobs they want, beeing their own ""boss"". But they're fully controlled by the companies they work for, even by the truck, that many has to buy themselves. So the companies offer to sell their truck, the worker pays it off, ofcourse with interest. And in the end, the trucker workers are just completely fucked over, no benefits, extra payments and paid by mileage they drive, often forced to wait hours at some stops with no pay.

Privatizing businesses isn't necessarily bad. But when almost everything is privatized, it creates problems since huge companies, use their money and influence to create more money, which almost always is bad for the average worker.",,aRr93WB,3,P

Always looking for a good $/mile rate, driver pays for the fuel, maintenance and weekly truck and trailer cost to the company. Weekly gross with a good dispatcher around 9-12k.
